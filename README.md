# -Dry-Bean-Classification
Classify the beans on the basis of the features provided
A computer vision system was developed to distinguish seven different registered varieties of dry beans with similar features in order to obtain uniform seed classification. Seven different types of dry beans were used in this research, taking into account the features such as form, shape, type, and structure by the market situation. For the classification model, images of 13,611 grains of 7 different registered dry beans were taken with a high-resolution camera. Bean images obtained by computer vision system were subjected to segmentation and feature extraction stages, and a total of 16 features; 12 dimensions and 4 shape forms, were obtained from the grains.

 

Your Task is to devise a Machine Learning model that classifies to which class each bean belongs to on the basis of the features provided.
